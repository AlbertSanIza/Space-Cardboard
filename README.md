# Space-Cardboard
This app was created for the purpose of participating on the [Angular Cardboard Hack-a-thon](https://angular.io/cardboard/).

Some of the amazing technologies used include:
  - [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)
  - [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/)
  - [Three.js](http://threejs.org/)

Because it's based on the Ionic Framework and its Cardboard starter template, you can preview the app by downloading the [Ionic View App](http://view.ionic.io/) and entering this APP ID:
```
D118CB8F
```
If you have a better knowledge on the Ionic Framework you can download this project and do the installation, both iOS and Android.
